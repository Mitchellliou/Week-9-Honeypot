# Week-9-Honeypot
I deployed a dionaea, a conpot, and an elastichoney honeypot. A problem I encountered was that I used Amazon Web Services to host the virtual machine. I'm not sure if I did something incorrectly but Amazon sent me an email saying that they noticed my machine was scanning hosts on the internet for security vulnerabilities. I also didn't recieve any attacks except for my own attacks. I just terminated all of the machines and redid everything and then it all worked. I recieved 279 attacks from many different places. Most of the attacks, though, were from the United States. I also did not recieve any attacks to my conpot or my elastichoney honeypots. There were no questions raised.
